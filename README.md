# ToKa Fitness - Digital Solution 
As a practice project for my 2025 T-Level Technical Digital Production, Design and Development course, I developed this digital solution prototype for ToKa Fitness. The goal was to create a platform offering fitness training and healthy living advice, access to digital content, and increased engagement with ToKa Fitness services.
